overview of My Drag-and-Drop Flags Game Project
I'm excited to share my latest project, a Drag-and-Drop Flags Game that challenges players to match country flags with their corresponding country names. This project combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and educational game.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices, whether you're playing on a desktop or a mobile device.

Touch and Mouse Support: I've implemented drag-and-drop functionality that works seamlessly on both touch screens and traditional mouse-based devices. This makes the game accessible to a wide audience.

Randomized Content: Each game session presents three randomly selected countries from a predefined list. The flags and country names are shuffled, providing a unique challenge every time you play.

Victory Condition: The game ends when all three flags are correctly matched to their respective countries, displaying a win message to the player.

How It Works:
Start the Game: Players start by clicking a button that triggers the game to randomly select three countries and display their flags and names.

Drag and Drop: Players can then drag each flag and drop it onto the correct country name. The game tracks whether the flag is placed correctly and provides immediate feedback by updating the UI.

Winning the Game: Once all flags are correctly matched, the game displays a congratulatory message, letting the player know theyâ€™ve won.

This project was a fun way to put my front-end development skills to the test, particularly in handling dynamic UI elements and ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. I enjoyed the challenge of implementing the drag-and-drop feature to be intuitive and responsive. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on this project!
